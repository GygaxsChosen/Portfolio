This program in its current state accepts an integer from the user and generates that number of random integers whose value ranges from 0-100, The program then sorts them from slmallest to largest using a bublesort algorithim, and reports the finished list and time in miliseconds the operation took.

*note*
In future versions this program is going to have multi algorithim support, to allow for comparison bewteen the sorting speeds of different algorithims, for different volumes of information, This is not yet implemented.
